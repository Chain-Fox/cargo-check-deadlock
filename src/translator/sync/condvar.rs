//! Representation of a condition variable in the Petri net.
//!
//! The behavior of the condition variable is modelled using
//! four places and two transitions. The corresponding net is:
//!
//! ```dot
//! digraph condvar {
//!     wait_enabled [shape="circle" xlabel="wait_enabled" label="â€¢"];
//!     notify [shape="circle" xlabel="notify" label=""];
//!     waiting [shape="circle" xlabel="waiting" label=""];
//!     waiting_for_lock [shape="circle" xlabel="waiting_for_lock" label=""];
//!     lost_signal [shape="box" xlabel="" label="lost_signal"];
//!     notify_received [shape="box" xlabel="" label="notify_received"];
//!     wait_enabled -> lost_signal;
//!     notify -> lost_signal;
//!     lost_signal -> wait_enabled;
//!     notify -> notify_received;
//!     waiting -> notify_received;
//!     notify_received -> waiting_for_lock;
//!     notify_received -> wait_enabled;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `wait_enabled` and `lost_signal` model the behavior of lost signals.
//! There is a conflict between the two transitions. If `wait()` is called before `notify()`,
//! the token in `notify` will be consumed by `lost_signal`.
//! But if `wait()` is called first, then the token from `wait_enabled` will be removed,
//! preventing the `lost_signal` from firing and ensuring that a token in `waiting_for_lock`
//! is set, which will allow the waiting thread to continue.
//!
//! This Petri net model is a slightly simplified version of the one presented in the paper
//! "Modelling Multithreaded Applications Using Petri Nets" by Kavi, Moshtaghi and Chen.
