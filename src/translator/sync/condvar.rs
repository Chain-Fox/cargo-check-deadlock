//! Representation of a condition variable in the Petri net.
//!
//! The behavior of the condition variable is modelled using
//! four places and two transitions. The corresponding net is:
//!
//! ```dot
//! digraph condvar {
//!     lost_signal_possible [shape="circle" xlabel="lost_signal_possible" label="â€¢"];
//!     signal_input [shape="circle" xlabel="signal_input" label=""];
//!     wait_input [shape="circle" xlabel="wait_input" label=""];
//!     signal_output [shape="circle" xlabel="signal_output" label=""];
//!     lost_signal_transition [shape="box" xlabel="" label="lost_signal_transition"];
//!     signal_transition [shape="box" xlabel="" label="signal_transition"];
//!     lost_signal_possible -> lost_signal_transition;
//!     signal_input -> lost_signal_transition;
//!     lost_signal_transition -> lost_signal_possible;
//!     signal_input -> signal_transition;
//!     wait_input -> signal_transition;
//!     signal_transition -> signal_output;
//!     signal_transition -> lost_signal_possible;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `lost_signal_possible` and `lost_signal_transition` model the behavior of lost signals.
//! There is a conflict between the two transitions. If `wait()` is called before `signal()`,
//! the token in `signal_input` will be consumed by `lost_signal_transition`.
//! But if `wait()` is called first, then the token from `lost_signal_possible` will be removed,
//! preventing the `lost_signal_transition` from firing and ensuring that a token in `signal_output`
//! is set, which will allow the waiting thread to continue.
//!
//! This Petri net model is a slightly simplified version of the one presented in the paper
//! "Modelling Multithreaded Applications Using Petri Nets" by Kavi, Moshtaghi and Chen.
