//! Representation of a condition variable in the Petri net.
//!
//! The behavior of the condition variable is modelled using
//! two places and three transitions, plus some additional places for the mutex
//! and the variable containing the condition for the condition variable.
//! The corresponding net can be found in `./assets/condition_variable_model.dot`
//! and `./assets/condition_variable_model.svg`.
//!
//! `wait_enabled` and `lost_signal` model the behavior of lost signals.
//! There is a conflict between the two transitions. If `wait()` is called before `notify()`,
//! the token in `notify` will be consumed by `lost_signal`.
//! But if `wait()` is called first, then the token from `wait_enabled` will be removed,
//! preventing `lost_signal` from firing and ensuring that an output token is set,
//! which will allow the waiting thread to continue.
//!
//! This Petri net model is a modified version of the one presented in the paper
//! "Modelling Multithreaded Applications Using Petri Nets" by Kavi, Moshtaghi and Chen.
//! <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220091454_Modeling_Multithreaded_Applications_Using_Petri_Nets>
//! The model was extended to model the condition on which the condition variable waits
//! and unnecessary intermediate places were removed.
