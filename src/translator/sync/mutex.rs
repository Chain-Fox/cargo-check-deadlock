//! Representation of a mutex and a mutex guard in the Petri net.
//!
//! The mutex stores one reference to the place in the Petri net
//! that models the state of the mutex. It also stores a vector
//! of transitions where the value of the mutex was set.
//! This enables modelling the condition in a while loop for a condition variable.
//! Every value assigned after dereferencing a mutex guard associated to the mutex
//! will be treated as if setting a boolean flag for a condition variable.
//!
//! If the place has a token, the mutex is unlocked.
//! If the place does not have a token, the mutex is locked.
//!
//! A mutex guard simply contains a reference to the corresponding mutex.
